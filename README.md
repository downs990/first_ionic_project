# first_ionic_project

This is the first application that I've created using the Ionic Capacitor framework with React.js

It is also the very first cross-platform / progressive-web-app (PWA) that I've ever created.

# Concept

The concept for this application is very simple. It generates a pattern of white squares that you have to memorize within 1 second and then recreate after the pattern is cleared. After every successful set of recreated patterns that you enter, the app will generate a new pattern. It will keep appending a new pattern to the sequence of existing patterns for you to recreate until you mess up. It is a similar idea as the old Simon color game.

# Screenshots
